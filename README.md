A repository dedicated to a supplement for the article by DÃ©fossez et al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-023-00714-5), improving speech representation accuracy and reducing the network's parameter count by 40%. 'Baseline 270' refers to the initial version of the code, 'br6-sp3d-270' is the version with my spatial harmonic layer, and 'br-sp3d-base' is the version with my harmonics and reduced parameter count. My solution involves creating a 3D Spatial Attention Matrix, constructed using vector spherical harmonics. Additionally, I reduce the number of parameters in the neural network by decreasing the convolutional layer size at the end of the Subject Block and selecting the optimal number of temporal convolutions (4) in the Subject Layer. The accuracy of the model is maintained through a more accurate interpretation of the input data in the Spatial Attention layer.
